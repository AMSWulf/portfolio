            <p class="whitetxt"> I have an interest in reading, running and music as well as a passion for ASL. 
            My long term goal is to attend M.I.T to have a better education. I hope to have a decent amount of money in the future so that I can 
            either retire early or have more than enough to do whatever I want. I intend to pursue programming to become 
            either a web designer, game designer, or help with cyber security.</p>
