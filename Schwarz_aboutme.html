                <p class="justify-left whitetxt">Hi! I am a learning programmer with interests in cyber security and web/game design. My goal is to attend the high level programming colleges and increase my skill and vary my field of expertise. I plan to accomplish this goal by studying, taking advanced courses, and maintaining a 4.0 gpa. I know that programming is crucial to run almost everything we need or like in the modern age</p>
                <p class="justify-left whitetxt">I have shown my ability to collaborate well, be creative, motivated and innovative through my shared projects. 
                I also work well alone and will work as long as I need to get my projects done by the deadline.</p>
                <!--Need more content here-->
                <p class="justify-left whitetxt">I am patient, athletic, good at making plans for projects and trouble-shooting errors. I enjoy figuring things out, reading and improving myself. I hope to attend Massachusetts Institute of Technology to further my skills in the programming field. This is so that I can reach my endgoal, which is to work in cyber security/web design.</p>
