                    <p>For this project I worked with my partner Shriya to design a game that had levels and increasing difficulties as our tier one objective.
                    We developed a game I had started making for fun and added levels, backgrounds, displays, and
                        powerups as well as timers.</p>

                    <p>For this project I worked with my partner David to create a pizza ordering app from a template and then modify it. It started as a quick select menu app connected to a fusion table to store 'orders'. The first thing we did was add
                        a comment box and more options. Afterwards I added prices to each item followed by a tracker of the total cost. </p>
