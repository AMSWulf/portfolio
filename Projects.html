                    <h6><strong>Duration:</strong>About 2 weeks(August 2018-September 2018)</h6>
                    <h6><strong>Objective:</strong>Create a game with multiple levels and facets</h6>
                    <h6><strong>Type of Project:</strong> Collaborative</h6>
                    <h6><strong>Skills Learned:</strong> Importance of Collaboration and how to use Scratch more efficiently</h6>
                    <br>
                    <p>For this project I worked with my partner Shriya to design a game that had levels and increasing difficulties as our tier one objective. 
                    We developed a game I had started making for fun and added levels, backgrounds, displays, and
                        powerups as well as timers. This taught me the value of working on a team, 
                        where I had short-comings artistically my partner would help as we both focused on our areas of strength to create a good looking,well functioning game.</p>

                    <p>For this project I worked with my partner David to create a pizza ordering app from a template and then modify it. 
                    It started as a quick select menu app connected to a fusion table to store 'orders'. The first thing we did was add
                        a comment box and more options. Afterwards I added prices to each item followed by a tracker of the total cost. </p>
