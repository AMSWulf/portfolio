                    <h6><strong>Duration:</strong>About 2 weeks(August 2018-September 2018)</h6>
                    <h6><strong>Objective:</strong>Create a game with multiple levels and facets</h6>
                    <h6><strong>Type of Project:</strong> Collaborative</h6>
                    <h6><strong>Skills Learned:</strong> Importance of Collaboration and how to use Scratch more efficiently</h6>
                    <br>
                    <p class="whitetxt">For this project I worked with my partner Shriya to design a game that had levels and increasing difficulties as our tier one objective. 
                    We developed a game I had started making for fun and added levels, backgrounds, displays, and
                        powerups as well as timers. This taught me the value of working as a team, 
                        where I had short-comings artistically my partner would help as we both focused on our areas of strength to create a good looking,well functioning game.</p>

                    <p class="whitetxt">For this project I worked with my partner David to create a pizza ordering app from a template and then modify it. 
                    It started as a quick select menu app connected to a fusion table to store 'orders'. The first thing we did was add
                        a comment box and more options. Afterwards I added prices to each item followed by a tracker of the total cost. </p>

                    <h6><strong>Course:</strong>CSP(Computer Science principles)</h6>
                    <h6><strong>Duration:</strong> About 1 month(February 25, 2019-March 28, 2019)</h6>
                    <h6><strong>Objective:</strong>Create a program or programs that manipulate an image in several ways</h6>
                    <h6><strong>Type of Project:</strong> Collaborative</h6>
                    <h6><strong>Skills Learned:</strong>How to use Python documentation as well as creative thinking</h6>

                    <p class="whitetxt">For this project I worked with my partner Tuetrung to create a series of programs 
                    which were then integrated into a straightforward user interface. Our result was an easy to use interface which can invert image colors, 
                    resize images, overlay images and add borders using nothing but python coding.</p>
